# Learning Basics of Ruby
Welcome to the Ruby Basics repository! This repository is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of the Ruby programming language. Whether you're new to programming or already have experience with other languages, this guide will provide you with resources and exercises to get started with Ruby.

Prerequisites
Before diving into learning Ruby, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Basic understanding of programming concepts.
A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your machine.

Getting Started
To start learning the basics of Ruby, follow these steps:
Setup Ruby Environment: Ensure Ruby is properly installed on your machine. You can verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
      ruby --version
Understanding Ruby Syntax: Familiarize yourself with Ruby syntax, including variables, data types, control structures (loops and conditionals), functions (methods), classes, and modules. You can find resources like Ruby Documentation or Ruby Guides to learn these concepts.

Writing Your First Ruby Program: Create a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started. Open your text editor or IDE, create a new file named hello.rb, and write the following code:
    puts "Hello, World!"

Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing hello.rb and run the following command:
    ruby hello.rb
